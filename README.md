    <h3>My personal portfolio built with React.js, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, hosted with Vercel!</h3>
</div>

Hello visitors, thank you for taking the time to come and visit the repo of my latest portfolio website! I created this portfolio mainly to freshen up my skills using the latest React.js functional components and practicing TypeScript. It is also developed to showcase what I have learned, contributed and done as a developer throughout the years. Although its not much currently, I am planning to expend this website further in the future with more personal projects, so stay tuned!

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run:

### Start Web server:
`npm install` to install the necessary dependencies

`npm start` to start the local server for development

`npm run build` to start building for production

## What I used:

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to draw the initial design

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to code on

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style faster

[React.js](https://react.dev/) bread and butter of the website

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type specification in JS

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting my website
